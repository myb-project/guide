# Obtaining and installing MyBee

Most of the settings are made after the system is installed. After rebooting, you can use access to the server IP address via SSH, or use the WS console via a browser: http://IP/shell/

## Interactive installer

You can get the installation ISO image (CD/DVD) or IMG image (USB memstick) from the official website [in the Downloads section](https://myb.convectix.com/download/).

The MyBee installer is text-based and optimized for the easiest and fastest installation with a minimum number of questions, however, you will need to:

- set the user password 'root';
- select the disk or list of disks on which you want to install the system;
- specify the correct network settings (DHCP or static address);

## Unattended mode
